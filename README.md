# ThirtyDollarWebsiteConverter

Hello! If you're reading this then you're searching for things related to the Thirty Dollar Website https://thirtydollar.website/ and found this project. 

This project is an experiment to see how to work with PCM audio. It takes a .ðŸ—¿ file and uses it's data to form a playable track. 

(Will be added in the future, as it now outputs raw PCM instead of the WAVE format) 

(yes I know that it takes 44 bytes, it's not that important to me now)

To use the audio made by this project, you need to open it in Audacity using Import > Raw Data, and using the settings: 

"Encoding: Singned 16-bit PCM", 

"Byte order: Little Endian", 

"Channels: 1", 

or use it in something else that supports raw PCM.
 
If you want to help, please feel free to submit pull requests, as I am rather incompetent in working with PCM samples and audio in general.
