# ThirtyDollarWebsiteConverter

Hello! If you're reading this then you're searching for things related to the Thirty Dollar Website https://thirtydollar.website/ and found this project. 

WARNING: This projects supports sequences made before the recent update.

This project is an experiment (which isn't completed yet, to see the things that I've done look at the bottom of the README) to see how to work with PCM audio. It takes a .ðŸ—¿ file and uses it's data to form a playable track. 

For now it only outputs .wav files, but I will add support for more formats in the future (mp3 and flac).
 
If you want to help, please feel free to submit pull requests, as I am rather incompetent in working with PCM samples and audio in general.

NOTE: If you want to help me develop this program, but can't code, please submit sequences using pull requests, or send them to me on Discord: t1stm#0329
