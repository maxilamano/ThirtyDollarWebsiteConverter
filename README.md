# Thirty Dollar Website Converter

Hello! If you're reading this then you're searching for things related to the Thirty Dollar Website https://thirtydollar.website/ and found this project. 

This project is an experiment to learn how to work with PCM audio. **It takes a .ðŸ—¿ file and uses it's data to form a playable track.** 

For now it only outputs .wav audio files, but I will add support for more formats in the future (MP3 and FLAC).

## Running The Program.

Using this application is quite simple. **If you're on Windows, you can hop onto the [releases tab](https://github.com/t1stm/ThirtyDollarWebsiteConverter/tags "Releases page link"), and download the latest copy of the compiled application.**
If you're using an other operating system, you can either run the Windows application in [WINE](https://www.winehq.org/ "Wine Is Not an Emulator") or compile the project manually and use the command line debug app.

If you want a more in-depth explanation, please follow the links for your operating system.

In-depth explanation for Windows GUI: **To be added.**

In-depth explanation for Linux / MacOS? / Windows CLI?: **To be added.**

That's it. Thank you for reading this.
